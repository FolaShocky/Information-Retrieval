# Text-Analysis-Application

## Overview
This repository contains code for a project I am working on which revolves around the analysis of words. The goal of the project is to provide a means by which one can see the number of times they have used a given word with the exception of stopwords (commonly used words lacking meaning; for example, "and", "to" or "but"), in a supplied piece of text, providing insight into the words we tend to use. There will be a facility which shows the frequency of each word in graphical form. The two languages I have chosen for this project are Java and Scala, the former as it is what Javafx, my framework of choice for the Graphical User Interface (GUI), is implemented in and Scala for its concision, expressiveness and high compatibility with the Apache Spark framework. Given that this is a microservices-oriented application, I am using Java Spring Boot to communicate between services. I also intend to use the Scala Play framework, where Scala is the microservice's primary language.
